The users need to find the best parking lot section according to their desination,wich is 
choosen on the mobile app.For this reason we desingned the campus as a graph,wich includes 
the parking lot sections and general areas of destination(Library,Gym,Enginnering Building).

Green nodes represent the parking lot sections,the yellow ones the destination areas and the 
blue node is the entrance.Wich is the strating point in the graph.
